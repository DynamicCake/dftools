# DfTools
A decentralized and federated, unofficial DiamondFire API ecosystem

## Archived
This project has been canceled in favour for a simpler, [DFQueue](https://github.com/DynamicCake/dfqueue).
The idea of DFQueue is to bring primatives to plots to allow them to build more advanced systems.

# Tools
- [Instance](./docs/instance.md#instance) - Communicate with other instances
- [Baton](./docs/baton.md#baton) - Plot transfers
- [xPlot](./docs/baton.md#xplot) - Cross plot communication

# DFJson
A JSON format that allows easy transmission of DiamondFire values

Probably will become a rust library
